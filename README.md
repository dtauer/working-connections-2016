## Working Connections 2016

###Day 1-2: Web Designer Workflows

In this course, we will create a mobile-first, responsive web site. We’ll start by looking at how to approach a new design. Then we’ll take our design and move it to the browser writing all the HTML and CSS necessary to bring our design to life. The goal is to get hands-on experience using the latest techniques of a modern web designer.

**Day 3-5: JavaScript Web Applications**

In this course, we will code a progressive JavaScript web application. We’ll look at how to add “app-like” features to make it look and feel like a mobile app while still functioning like a website. We’ll write code for loading dynamic data, managing the browser history, and other progressive techniques like offline support. We’ll explore some of the tools JavaScript developers use to automate the testing process and create production versions of the application.
